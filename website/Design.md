# The Design of a Database-Driven Web Application for NCEA Level 3

Project Name: **Richmond hall booking app**

Project Author: **YUUKI HEISSSNER**

Assessment Standards: **91902** and **91903**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

There is a problem where the current hall booking website does not work on mobile devices even though most of the bookings happen on mobile. you can also not make accounts your self so every time someone wants to make an account they need to call the hall owner and ask to make an account. I will be solving this problem by making a website/app that is easier to navigate and use on mobile, and also making it so anyone can make an account on their own devices. 

### End-User Requirements

The Richmond hall owner and usual users are the clients. The hall owner has an website set up for the usual users to book the courts with their accounts but whenever someone new wants to create an account they have to call the hall owner to open an account. The usual users also struggle to use this website on their mobile devices.  
The hall users will want to see clearly what times on what dates they can book, they will also want to easily navigate through the website. For example, they should be able to go the next week, next day. 
The hall owner will like so the usual users and other users can use this website without doing anything himself.  

### Proposed Solution

clients should be able to do: 
 - create an account 
 - log in/out of their account 
 - view what dates they can book

what the all owner should be able to do:
- see all accounts registered
